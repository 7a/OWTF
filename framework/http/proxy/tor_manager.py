        1)Open torrc file usually located at '/etc/tor/torrc'
          if you can't find torrc file visit https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#torrc
        2)Enable the TOR control port by uncommenting(removing the hash(#) symbol) 
          or adding the following line
          should look like this  "ControlPort 9051".
        3)Generate a new hashed password by running the following command
            "tor --hash-password 'your_password'
        4)Uncomment "HashedControlPassword" and add the previously generated hash
          should look like the following but with you hash
          HashedControlPassword 16:52B319480CED2E0860BAEA7565ECCF628A59FEE59B6E0592CD3F01C710
 
        Recommended Setting:
             ControlPort 9051
             HashedControlPassword 16:52B319480CED2E0860BAEA7565ECCF628A59FEE59B6E0592CD3F01C710
             The above hashed password is 'owtf'
        Advantages of recommended settings
           You can run owtf TOR mode without specifying the options
               ex.  ./owtf.py -o OWTF-WVS-001 http:my.website.com --tor ::::
                 which is the same with 127.0.0.1:9050:9051:owtf:5
