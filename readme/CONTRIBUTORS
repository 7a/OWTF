If you want to become a project contributor you might want to have a look at this:

Project page: http://owtf.org
github page: https://github.com/7a/owtf
owtf git installation script (very basic atm): owtf_dir/install/install_git.sh
GIT installation/setup instructions: http://help.github.com/linux-set-up-git/

Development IDE: After using only vi for months I switched to: eclipse + pydev
Installation steps (should work fine on Ubuntu / Backtrack):
1) apt-get install eclipse
Below is mostly from these guides but correcting the pydev.org URL: 
http://pluthon.garage.maemo.org/1st_edition/pydev.html
http://cs.calvin.edu/curriculum/cs/106/resources/pythonOnEclipse/1.installingPyDev/
2) (From Eclipse) Help / Install New Software / "Add"
3) On the dialog box: Name -> PyDev. Location: http://pydev.org/updates
4) Click on the PyDev checkbox that appears below
5) Next / Next / Finish :)
6) Trust the Atana certificate
7) Restart Eclipse
8) Create new OWTF project selecting PyDev
9) Click on "Please configure an interpreter .."
10) On the python interpreters box (at the top) click "New"
11) Interpreter name: python2.6 + Interpreter Location: /usr/bin/python2.6 (or run whereis python2.6)
12) ok, apply + fight until you get the settings you like :P
13) This might help: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/186118/eclipse-fonts-and-background-color
14) Right click on code window / Preferences / Click on "Show whitespace characters" and make sure that "insert spaces for tabs" is DISABLED!!!
15) Ensure when you click on the "tab" key there are no dots "." and if so: right click on code window / Toggle force tabs
NOTE: The OWTF codebase uses tabs for indentation, please be consistent with this. Thank you.
If you are like me you might find the following helpful to have word wrap working in Eclipse:

16) External library method/properties completion:
Project / PyDev - PYTHON PATH / External libraries tab / Add Source Folder:
/usr/share/pyshared/twisted (for twisted completion, location on bactrack 5)

right click on editor window / preferences DOES NOT WORK for many things you should:
Go to Window / Preferences / PyDev / Editor and adjust your settings here (tab defaults here override the Eclipse defaults, for example)

To use vim from Eclipse for free:
TODO: http://sourceforge.net/projects/eclim/

DID NOT WORK:
1) Download this: http://sourceforge.net/projects/vimplugin/
2) Copy it here (Backtrack 5, but you get the idea): /usr/lib/eclipse/plugins
3) Restart Eclipse
4) Go to Window / Preferences / Vim Plugin / set the location to: /usr/bin/vim
5)
