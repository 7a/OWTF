OWTF was initially conceived and started from August 2011 by Abraham Aranguren, 
as a personal project. The project was first presented publicly at the 
BerlinSides conference in December 2011 and was released, as an open source 
project, one week later in January 2012. OWTF became OWASP OWTF after being 
accepted as an OWASP project in August 2012.
