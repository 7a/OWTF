**OWASP OWTF** is a project focused on penetration testing efficiency
and alignment of security tests to security standards like the OWASP
Testing Guide (v3 and v4), the OWASP Top 10, PTES and NIST so that
pentesters will have more time to

- See the big picture and think out of the box
- More efficiently find, verify and combine vulnerabilities
- Have time to investigate complex vulnerabilities like business
  logic/architectural flaws or virtual hosting sessions
- Perform more tactical/targeted fuzzing on seemingly risky areas
- Demonstrate true impact despite the short timeframes we are
  typically given to test.

The tool is highly configurable and anybody can trivially create simple
plugins or add new tests in the configuration files without having any
development experience.

> **Note**: This tool is however not a **silverbullet** and will only be
> as good as the person using it: Understanding and experience will be
> required to correctly interpret tool output and decide what to
> investigate further in order to demonstrate impact.

# Requirements

OWTF is developed on KaliLinux and macOS but it is made for Kali Linux
(or other Debian derivatives)

OWTF supports both Python2 and Python3.

# Installation

Recommended:

> Using a virtualenv is highly recommended!

#### Manually set up the database

Replace the variables `db_name`, `$db_user` and `$db_pass` with values from the `settings.py` file. Make sure the values
are exactly the same.

- Start the postgreSQL server,

  - macOS: `brew install postgresql` and `pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres start`
  - Kali: `sudo systemctl enable postgresql; sudo systemctl start postgresql`
    or `sudo service postgresql start`

- Create the `owtf_db_user` user,

  - macOS: `psql postgres -c "CREATE USER $db_user WITH PASSWORD '$db_pass';"`
  - Kali: `sudo su postgres -c "psql -c \"CREATE USER $db_user WITH PASSWORD '$db_pass'\""`

- Create the database,
  - macOS: `psql postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE $db_name WITH OWNER $db_user ENCODING 'utf-8' TEMPLATE template0;"`
  - Kali: `sudo su postgres -c "psql -c \"CREATE DATABASE $db_name WITH OWNER $db_user ENCODING 'utf-8' TEMPLATE template0;\""`

`pip install git+https://github.com/owtf/owtf#egg=owtf` or clone the
repo and `python setup.py develop`.

If you want to change the database password in the Docker Compose setup,
edit the environment variables in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

To run OWTF on Windows or MacOS, OWTF uses Docker Compose. You need to
have Docker Compose installed (check by `docker-compose -v`). After
installing Docker Compose, simply run `make compose` and open
`localhost:8009` for the OWTF web interface.

## Install on OSX

Dependencies: Install Homebrew (<https://brew.sh/>) and follow the steps
given below:

```{.sourceCode .bash}
$ virtualenv <venv name>
$ source <venv name>/bin/activate
$ brew install coreutils gnu-sed openssl
# We need to install 'cryptography' first to avoid issues
$ pip install cryptography --global-option=build_ext --global-option="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib" --global-option="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include"
$ git clone <this repo>
$ cd owtf
$ python setup.py install
# Run OWTF!
$ owtf
```

# Features

- **Resilience**: If one tool crashes **OWTF**, will move on to the
  next tool/test, saving the partial output of the tool until it
  crashed.
- **Flexible**: Pause and resume your work.
- **Tests Separation**: **OWTF** separates its traffic to the target
  into mainly 3 types of plugins:
  - **Passive** : No traffic goes to the target
  - **Semi Passive** : Normal traffic to target
  - **Active**: Direct vulnerability probing
- Extensive REST API.
- Has almost complete OWASP Testing Guide(v3, v4), Top 10, NIST, CWE
  coverage.
- **Web interface**: Easily manage large penetration engagements
  easily.
- **Interactive report**:
- **Automated** plugin rankings from the tool output, fully
  configurable by the user.
- **Configurable** risk rankings
- **In-line notes editor** for each plugin.
